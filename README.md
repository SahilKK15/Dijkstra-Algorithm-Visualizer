Graph Pathfinding Visualizer
An interactive web application for exploring various graph algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, and BFS. This tool is designed to help users understand how graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms work step-by-step through dynamic visualizations.

Features
Algorithm Support: Visualize Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A*, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Graph Creation: Drag and drop nodes to create custom graphs with weighted edges.
Interactive Visualization: Watch how each algorithm traverses the graph to find the optimal path.
Customizable Options: Adjust weights, add/remove nodes, and reset the graph.
Responsive Design: Compatible with all modern browsers and devices.
