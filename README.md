An interactive web application for exploring various graph algorithms, including Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, and BFS. This tool is designed to help users understand how graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms work step-by-step through dynamic visualizations.

Features
Algorithm Support: Visualize Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A*, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Graph Creation: Drag and drop nodes to create custom graphs with weighted edges.
Interactive Visualization: Watch how each algorithm traverses the graph to find the optimal path.
Customizable Options: Adjust weights, add/remove nodes, and reset the graph.
Responsive Design: Compatible with all modern browsers and devices.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of graph theory and algorithms.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-pathfinding-visualizer.git
cd graph-pathfinding-visualizer
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Add nodes and connect them with edges to form a graph.
Assign weights to edges by clicking on them.
Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click "Run" to see the step-by-step visualization.
Use the "Reset" button to start over.
Built With
